    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "\n",
    "a) Nearest Neighbors doesn't work well for this problem because having such an abundance of non-key words (ex. \"and\", \"the\", etc.) could lead to similarities between data that have different labels. Taking a straight distance across all the features weighted equally can easily lead to misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Naive Bayes works best with text classification because it assumes independence between predictors, which is important when we have far more features than we do samples. \n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "The tf-idf vectorizer performs the same first step as the CountVectorizer (converts raw data to a vocabulary set), but uses a combination of term frequency and inverse document frequency to weight each feature. Tf-idf assigns a heavier weight to features that appear frequently within one sample but not frequently in the entire sample space. This helps to weed out stop-words.\n",

    "These three samples show that the model doesn't assign appropriately high probabilities to certain relevant keywords. For example, the model doesn't realize that the word \"Mormon\" should have a high probability of being labeled as \"Religion.\" The third example contains several instances of the word \"Mormon\" but is combined with punctuation, so the model thinks it is an entirely new word. Some fixes would be to remove punctuation in the preprocessor or to manually assign a probability to keywords that are not being approriately represented."
